### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
**I'm Flax**
I primarily fovus on the development of Discord applications, such as bots.

### About
Over one year of experience developing with the Discord API, Roblox API,
databases, and VPS services - related to Discord bot development.
Based in the AEST timezone.

### Discord Experience
I use new Discord components such as message buttons, select menus,
interaction modals and context menus, and the newly required Discord
interaction; slash commands.

I can create clean and modern-looking UIs with Discord interactions and
message components.

### API's
I have experience with operating databases that are optimal for Discord
applications.

I have the ability to develop, use, and implement my own APIs that are used to
enhance your discord bot. This can allow remote interactions between your
Discord server and Roblox game; and vice versa.

I am able to operate hosting services for your Discord bot, such as a VPS to
keep your bot running 24/7.

### User Experience
Another ability that I portray is the experience that I have in user experience. I
have an extensive understanding of how Discord users interact with bots.
Being able to enhance an everyday userÊ¼s experience is an important skill for a
bot developer to have.

I can simplify the flow of utilising Discord botÊ¼s functions in order to make use
fast and understandable.

### Logging and Moderation
I can provide extensive logging features for your bot to log
important actions into channels or logging commands. This will allow for
easy lookup of any userÊ¼s past activity.

I offer punishment and moderation systems to your bot so we can tweak
moderator actions to your liking! The actions can be carried over Discord and
ingame in order to widen the scope of punishments against players.
